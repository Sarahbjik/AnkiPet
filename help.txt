The game starts out with an event, upon which you will be given care of your first pet. 

Care well for it and it will prosper!

You achieve this by doing the due cards for each day (due cards from the last three days are considered here). 
In case you only do a fraction, the progress is reduced but still present.
In case your progress is little the pet might suffer or die.

To gain progress you have to press the 'Resolve day' button once you are finished with your cards.
Mind that you can only do this once a day! 

When you collected enough reputation by caring well for the pet you might get further pet offers for your stable.
How well you recently cared for your stable is indicated by the mood of a smiley face.
The last 15 days are taken as a reference here.

The game will register if you care for your pets every single day or if there was a break for some period of time.

You can name your pets by clicking on them. Also, it can happen that a pet dies from old age.

Have fun!
